A collection of mini pytorch projects

Project Summaries
1. Tabular Classification: 
Classifies rice types using tabular data. Demonstrates data preprocessing, binary classification model design, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, showcasing how to handle structured data with PyTorch.

2. Basic CNN Image Classification:  
Implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification tasks. Introduces foundational concepts in image processing, CNN architecture, and training loops using PyTorch.

3. Image Classification with Pretrained Models: 
Utilizes transfer learning by adapting pretrained models like ResNet for custom image classification. Covers fine-tuning, modifying output layers, and improving performance on new datasets.

4. Audio Classification: 
Performs audio classification by converting audio files to spectrograms and applying CNNs. Includes custom dataset creation, audio preprocessing, and model training, highlighting PyTorchâ€™s flexibility with non-image data.
